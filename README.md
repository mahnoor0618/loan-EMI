# EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Calculator 🏦

This program calculates the **Monthly EMI** for a loan based on:
- Loan Amount (Principal)
- Annual Interest Rate (%)
- Loan Tenure (in years)

## 📌 Formula
EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N – 1]

- P → Loan Amount (Principal)
- R → Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
- N → Number of Months (Years × 12)

## ⚡ Example Output
For a loan of Rs 1,00,000 at 10% annual interest for 5 years → EMI = Rs 2124.70
